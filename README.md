### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Although I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering, I have always been connected with programming in various languages. I have experience in developing software solutions (solver, GUI, pre- and post-processing) for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), including creating a specialized processor for speeding up CFD computations. Currently, I am a full-stack developer of web and mobile applications using Flutter/Dart and Golang. I enjoy building user-friendly and responsive interfaces, as well as designing and implementing efficient and scalable back-end systems.
